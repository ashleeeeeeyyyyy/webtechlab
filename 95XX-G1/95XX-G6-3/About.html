            <h2> What is Peace & Order? </h2>
            <p>
                Peace & Order is the sense of tranquility and unity under one community. In a community an individual must be living in peace and must express theirselves comfortably, to be able to live in peace even despite when it's night time. Peace & Order is where you would feel safe in a community and where everything is organized and just. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Everyone in the community especially the barangay officials works hard everyday in-order to make sure that the community is organized and checks whether everything is in place and that there are no destruction of peace within the barangay itself.
