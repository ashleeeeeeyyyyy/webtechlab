        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Peace & Order is the sense of tranquility and unity under one community. In a community an individual must be living in peace and must express theirselves comfortably, to be able to live in peace even despite when it's night time. Peace & Order is where you would feel safe in a community and where everything is organized and just. Ofcourse who would want to live in a barangey that is not safe, organized and well-protected right? Everyone wants their family to be safe and sound no matter what time and place they go to within the barangay. Although some people are hard headed within the community by not following rules. Rules and Laws are implemented within the community so that those who are living and residing in the community would follow those rules and if they don't comply then consequences will be given to those who won't comply to these rules and laws in the barangay.
            </p>

            <p>
                The goal of Peace & Order is that everyone would be safe and protected, Not only that but the barangay should be well and proper that is why everyone in the community especially the barangay officials works hard everyday in-order to make sure that the community is organized and checks whether everything is in place and that there are no destruction of peace within the barangay itself. Some examples of these are curfews, no parking spaces, jeepney lines, no spitting and etc.
