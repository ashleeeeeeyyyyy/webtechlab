                        The No Spitting rule is strictly prohibited in the Dagsian barangay. Why? it makes the residence & community uncomfortable. Especially when walking you would see phleghm or maybe "Momma". Not only those but also spitting food like bubblegums, candies for it is also considered littering.

                        Transportation in the Dagsian barangay is hard for public tranpsportation vehicles don't go there that much making jeepney's or taxi's hard to find. Although some jeepney's go there in a certain place where all jeepney's stay. The line for jeepney's is long for many people within the community uses this vehicle. That's why the barangay implemented that when taking these vehicles they should make a line so that it wouldn't be too crowded and unorganized. There is a checker who is maintaining and organizing these people in the line, this rule would also prevent other people from cutting in the line so that it wouldn't lead to chaos.

                        Going home late is strictly prohibited in the Dagsian barangay, especially if you are 18years old & below. Why? because it's dangerous in the night time.

                        The Dagsian barangay is most strict with this rule. Which is the "No Dumping of Garbage here" Why? because it makes the barangay dirty and unpleasant to other people.

That's is why the barangay emposed this rule in-order to make the barangay clean and pleasant to live in.
