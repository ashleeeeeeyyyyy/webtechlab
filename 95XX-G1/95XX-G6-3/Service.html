                            Transportation in the Dagsian barangay is hard for public tranpsportation vehicles don't go there that much making jeepney's or taxi's hard to find. Although some jeepney's go there in a certain place where all jeepney's stay. The line for jeepney's is long for many people within the community uses this vehicle. That's why the barangay implemented that when taking these vehicles they should make a line so that it wouldn't be too crowded and unorganized. There is a checker who is maintaining and organizing these people in the line, this rule would also prevent other people from cutting in the line so that it wouldn't lead to chaos.
