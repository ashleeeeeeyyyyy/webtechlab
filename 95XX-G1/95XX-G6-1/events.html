                Sunday masses are being done weekly but unfortunately this happens in Scout Barrio.This happens in scout barrio because Lower Dagsian doesn't have a Roman Catholic church but they Lower Dagsian is still included in the church group together with Scout Barrio and Hillside Baranggay. Lower Dagsian has Born-again Church and they are open to join their preachings and servings.This happens twice-a-week.Lower Dagsian has also activities wherein group of people visits your home or house to pray with you.This activity shows the people to be more close to each other and reminds the baranggay to be more closer to our God. During big celebrations such as an Assembly,Birthday Party,Weddings,Christmas party or even if Manny Pacquiao has a fight,Religion and Culture plays a large role in this events.Through this, the people of the baranggay is gathered during this activities and promotes unity because of Religion and Culutural Activities.
