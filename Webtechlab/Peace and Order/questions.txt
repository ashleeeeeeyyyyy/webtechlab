Peace and order
1. What are the problems in your community that arise and how do you solve them?
2. Does your community have curfew hours?
3. What is the worst disturbance that you encountered?
4. Do the barangay tanods do their jobs properly?
5. Does your barangay hold programs or activities to keep youngsters away from illegal things?
